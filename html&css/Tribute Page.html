        <ul id="tl">
          <li><span class="bold">1815</span> - Born in London, UK</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1832</span> - meets and befriends Charles Babbage, and discusses her mathematical studies and Babbage’s gigantic clockwork calculating machine projects.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1842</span> - translates the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the Analytical Engine.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1844</span> - comments to a friend about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings ("a calculus of the nervous system"). In the same year, she writes a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1851</span> - writes to her mother mentioning "certain productions" she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1852</span> - dies at the age of 36</li>

          <li>On 27 July 2018, Senator Ron Wyden submitted, in the United States Senate, the designation of 9 October 2018 as National Ada Lovelace Day. The resolution (S.Res.592) was considered, and agreed to without amendment and with a preamble by unanimous consent. </li>
          <li>In March 2022, a statue of Ada Lovelace was installed at the site of the former Ergon House in the City of Westminster, London, honoring its scientific history.</li>
